foonoo
======
Like most static site generators, foonoo is designed to convert flat text files into websites that can be hosted almost anywhere. Foonoo provides site generators that convert your text files to specific kinds of sites, like the ever ubiquitous blog or a documentation website for your project. In cases where you want further control over the structure of your site, foonoo allows you to lump up all your text files and work with them directly as you please.
